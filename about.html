    <h1>About Wishmakers at VT</h1>
    <p>Wishmakers at VT is a service-oriented student organization at Virginia Tech that supports the Greater Virginia chapter of the Make-A-Wish Foundation.</p>
    <p>The club is open to students of all ages and majors and focuses on philanthropy, fundraising, and outreach that directly benefits local wish kids and families.</p>

    <h2>Why Wishes Matter</h2>
    <p>Wishes can serve as a turning point in a child’s treatment journey, boosting emotional well-being and giving families positive memories during difficult times.</p>
    <p>Make-A-Wish and its chapters grant thousands of wishes each year, with college-based Wishmakers on Campus groups playing an important fundraising role.</p>

    <h2>Community Outreach</h2>
    <p>Members support Carilion Children’s Hospital in Roanoke, Virginia, through hands-on activities that brighten the days of young patients and their families.</p>
    <p>Projects can include seasonal crafts and cards as well as helping with events that create a fun and encouraging environment for children receiving care.</p>
